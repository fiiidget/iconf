rpro1,https://www.rijksmuseum.nl/en/rijksstudio/subjects/birds,Rijks Museum,Birds,"Birds occur frequently and for a variety reasons in visual art, as symbols, decoration or objects of study. The symbolism of birds differs in different period and regions. For the Egyptians a bird symbolized the soul. Birds are often encountered in 17th-century Dutch genre scenes, in which they usually have a sexual connotation because the Dutch word ‘vogelen’ (birding) means to engage in sex. In medieval books of hours, birds had a purely ornamental function and were incorporated as faithfully as possible in the decorative borders. From the beginning of the 16th century birds became the subject of scientific study. Voyages of discovery fuelled interest in unknown, exotic species, which was reflected in the first illustrated encyclopedias.",19
rpro2,https://www.rijksmuseum.nl/en/rijksstudio/styles/the-hague-school,Rijks Museum,The Hague School,"The Hague School is a collective term for a group of painters active in The Hague between around 1860 and 1890. They reacted against the established painters of the art academy who idealized reality. In contrast, the Hague School painters, including Jozef Israels, the brothers Maris and Anton Mauve, aspired to render what they saw realistically. They admired the French Barbizon School artists, who just like them, worked as much as possible en plein air (out in nature). They were intent on capturing the light and atmosphere of a landscape. Initially, the colours used by the Hague School artists were fairly gloomy, consisting of mostly greyish tints. This changed under the influence of French Impressionism; their palette became lighter and brighter and the facture looser. A younger generation of painters in Amsterdam continued this less formal painting tradition; they were called the Amsterdam Impressionists. ",8
rpro3,https://www.rijksmuseum.nl/en/rijksstudio/works-of-art/paintings,Rijks Museum,Paintings,"Paintings are the Rijksmuseum’s calling card. The 17th-century Dutch works, in particular the masterpieces by Rembrandt, Frans Hals and Johannes Vermeer, enjoy national and international renown. The museum administers close to 6000 paintings on panel and on canvas. The collection of Early Netherlandish paintings is also famous; most of these panels have religious subjects and date from the 15th and 16th century. Moreover, there are also superb 14th-century portraits. After the Reformation, around 1600, painters began to specialize in a single subject. These new 'genres' were usually not, or only indirectly, religious in nature. Subjects that until then had been incorporated in religious scenes became independent genres, such as landscape, still life, and portraiture. Another genre was history painting; depictions of stories from the Bible, mythology or history. In addition, there were the popular genre scenes of people in their everyday surroundings, sometimes containing veiled symbolism. Because of the magnitude of the collection of paintings, they have been grouped by genre on the museum’s website.",7
rpro4,https://www.rijksmuseum.nl/en/rijksstudio/artists/johannes-vermeer,Rijks Museum,Johannes Verneer,"Today Johannes Vermeer (1632-1675) is one of the most celebrated Dutch 17th century masters. Yet for centuries little importance was attached to his name. Works now known as Vermeers were attributed to other artists. It was only in the 1870s that he was rediscovered and 35 paintings identified as his. The son of a silk worker who bought and sold art, Vermeer lived and worked in Delft all his life. He may have served his apprenticeship under fellow townsman Carel Fabritius. In 1653, he joined the local artists guild, which he led at various times. Vermeer’s early paintings of historical scenes reveal the influence of the Utrecht Caravaggists. His later paintings are meticulous compositions of interiors featuring one or two figures, usually women. These are intimate genre paintings in which the subject is engaged in some everyday activity, usually in the light of a nearby window. Vermeer could render the way light plays on objects like few others. The Rijksmuseum has three domestic interiors by Vermeer and one outdoor scene: his world-famous Little Street.",4
rpro5,https://www.rijksmuseum.nl/en/rijksstudio/artists/rembrandt-van-rijn,Rijks Museum,Rembrant van Rijn,"Rembrandt van Rijn (1606-1669) was born in Leiden, the son of a miller. After finishing Latin School, his parents enrolled him at Leiden University. Rembrandt soon dropped out and became an apprentice painter under Jacob van Swanenburch in Leiden, and later Pieter Lastman in Amsterdam. Back in Leiden, he set up as an independent artist together with Jan Lievens. At this time, Rembrandt mainly painted biblical scenes in a precise style and with vibrant colours. In 1631, he moved to Amsterdam where he received numerous commissions for portraits. His many pupils included Ferdinand Bol, Govert Flinck and Carel Fabritius. In this period, Rembrandt develop a more powerful chiaroscuro, a looser brush and a greater sense of drama. He focused more on historical scenes, and made numerous etchings and drawings. In 1634, Rembrandt married Saskia Uylenburgh. They had a son, Titus, in 1641. Then a year later Saskia died. Later, in 1654, Rembrandt had a daughter with Hendrickje Stoffels. By now, he had accumulated huge debts and was forced to sell his house and property. He died in 1669 and was buried in Amsterdam's Westerkerk.  ",22
rpro6,https://www.rijksmuseum.nl/en/rijksstudio/historical-figures/william-of-orange,Rijks Museum,William of Orange,"Born in Germany, William inherited the title of count of Nassau at birth. The young German count’s life was transformed when in 1544, when he inherited extensive lands in France and the Netherlands. These included an independent principality in southern France: Orange. Henceforth, he styled himself prince of Orange (later he was also referred to as William the Silent).

Philip II appointed him stadholder of Holland, Zeeland and Utrecht, the principal provinces. The characters and interests of the two men conflicted however, and they developed a mutual antipathy. Deeply pious, Philip tried to strengthen the monarchy’s central authority and to maintain an exclusive monopoly for the Catholic Church. To achieve this he persecuted Protestants relentlessly. By contrast, William supported freedom of religion and conscience.

Protestant preachers whipped up crowds to destroy idolatrous decorations in churches. In response, Philip II sent an army to restore order. For four years, William led the defence of Holland and Zeeland against the Spanish army. Once the prospect of Spain reestablishing control had subsided in 1576, the provinces decided to continue as a confederation. William of Orange stood at the helm. In 1579, the seventeen provinces split into a Protestant North that supported the rebellion, and a Catholic South. The Spanish army renewed its campaign against the northern provinces.

In 1580, Philip II issued an urgent appeal to the people, an edict outlawing William. He declared the prince a walking target. On 10 July 1584, the fatal blow was struck. William of Orange was at Prinsenhof, his residence in Delft. As he was climbing the stairs, an assassin appeared and fired a pistol at him. His killer, Balthasar Gerards, claimed to have murdered William of Orange to save the world from that cruel and dreadful man who though a member of the nobility had turned away from the true Catholic faith purely and exclusively out of pride and lust for power and fame.",8

Like his brother and fellow artist Andries Both, he worked for a period in Rome. There he met Frenchman Claude Lorrain, with whom he collaborated on a series of landscape paintings. Everyday life of the streets of Rome developed into one of his favourite themes. On his return to Utrecht (probably in 1642) he stopped painting genre pieces and focused instead on pictures of Italian landscapes bathed in a warm, golden light. This was a style several other Dutch painters had also adopted: they were known as Italianists.",6

Later, he moved back to Leiden, where he worked together with Rembrandt for over five years. After 1631, Lievens struck out in a different direction; he spent three years in London. His style began to change under the influence of Anthony van Dyck’s portraits. And when he saw Rubens’s work in Antwerp in 1635, Lievens adopted the Baroque style completely. In 1644, Lievens returned to Amsterdam, where he remained for the rest of his life. He received major commissions in the Dutch Republic. Stadholder Frederik Hendrik’s widow, Amalia van Solms, invited him to paint for the Orange room at Huis ten Bosch. The city of Amsterdam was another major patron. Lievens provided a canvas for the burgomasters’ chamber in the new town hall.",6
rpro9,https://www.rijksmuseum.nl/en/rijksstudio/styles/rococo,Rijks Museum,Rococo,"The Rococo, or late Baroque style, coincided with the reign of King Louis XV (1723-1774) in France, which is why it is also called the ‘Louis XV style’. Its impact was strongest on interior decoration and applied art. Asymmetry and irregularity typify the Rococo, a 19th-century term derived from rocaille (French for rockwork), that is fanciful rock and shell ornamentation. Other Rococo elements are C-scrolls, vines, pastel colours and serpentine lines. In this period graceful shepherds and shepherdesses and Chinoiserie motifs populate porcelain objects, as well as paintings, like those by the French artist Jean Étienne Liotard. This elegant style found a following throughout Europe, and in the 18th-century Netherlands manifested itself in the decorative arts, clothing, portraits and miniatures. Typical of the period are the grisailles imitating stucco reliefs by Jan de Wit called ‘witjes’ (a play on his name, which means white in Dutch).",19

After David succeeded Saul as king of Israel he met Bathsheba, the beautiful wife of his general, Uriah. David saw Bathsheba while she was bathing. He had her brought to the palace and made love to her. When David learned that Bathsheba was with child, he ensured Uriah’s death by sending him out to the front lines of battle and married her. She bore a son, but he only survived a few days, and David subsequently realized and did penance for his sin. David and Bathsheba conceived a second son, Solomon, who succeeded his father. The scene of Bathsheba bathing has featured regularly in art since the Middle Ages. David is also a subject in his own right, and is depicted playing his harp. He was an ancestor of Mary and Joseph, and therefore of Jesus.",5

Verspronck,"Johannes Cornelisz Verspronck (1600/03-1662) of Haarlem was probably apprenticed to his father, portraitist Cornelis Engelsz (Versprongh), and possibly also to Frans Hals, of the same city. Hals’s influence on his manner of painting is certainly evident in Verspronck’s work. In 1632, he joined Haarlem’s St Luke’s guild. Verspronck developed a sober, restrained style of portraiture. He lived for many years with his parents and remained a rather isolated figure in Haarlem’s art circles.

Apart from a single still life and various genre paintings, most of Verspronck’s works are portraits. He was particularly productive in the years 1640 to 1643, when he made two group portraits and over twenty individual portraits. In all, he painted around a hundred portraits.",6

The core of the collection comprises Dutch glass, either produced and/or engraved in the Netherlands. Inscriptions and images were engraved on glass in a variety of techniques particularly in the 17th and 18th century. Among the exceptional objects are a roemer with a poem to Constantijn Huygens engraved by Anna Roemer Visscher, a dish with a calligraphed text by the glass engraver and poet Willem van Heemskerk, and an elegant wine glass with a scene engraved by Willem Fortuyn.

This amount is actually modest given that Asia is the largest continent on earth, with more than 50 different countries, from Afghanistan to South Korea. The four key regions represented in the collection are: China, Japan, India, and Indonesia combined. The museum collects the best possible examples of Asian art from all of these regions and from all periods.

Many of these objects were made for local patrons and thus give an idea of the kinds of (art) objects that were considered important in Asia itself. They range from paintings, prints, sculptures and temple ornaments to lacquer boxes, jewellery, funerary urns, tea bowls and miniatures.

Other objects were made for export to Europe and thus reflect a more Western taste.
The Rijksmuseum is the only museum in the Netherlands that collects Asian art- ethnology museums tend to concentrate more on culture. A significant part of the Asian art collection is a long-term loan from the Vereniging van Vrienden der Aziatische Kunst.",46

He served as adviser to Grand Pensionary Johan van Oldenbarnevelt. At the end of the 16th century he was appointed court chaplain of Stadholder-Prince Maurice. However, the stadholder and the preacher came to oppose each other during the Twelve Years’ Truce with Spain (1609-1621).

A founder of a critical liberal movement (the Remonstrant Brotherhood) within the Protestant Church, Wtenbogaert came into conflict with Maurice and more orthodox Protestants. He fell into disfavour, was banned, and fled to Antwerp in 1618. After the death of Prince Maurice, in 1626 Wtenbogaert returned to the Netherlands and preached in Remonstrant churches.

Then, around 1627, he began to move towards a more monochrome palette (from the Greek monochromos, ‘one colour’). His landscapes generally contain just one or two colours: like Salomon van Ruysdael, he worked mainly in greens and greys. Van Goyen was one of the most prolific artists of the 17th century and his tremendous output inevitably led to repetition. Some 1,200 paintings and 800 drawings are known by Van Goyen. Many of the latter were made on his travels around the Netherlands, France and Germany. He lived in Leiden from 1618 to 1632, spending his last years in The Hague.",6

As different in nature as they may be, all of these works on paper share one important characteristic, namely they are fragile and extremely sensitive to light. For this reason, they are generally kept in storage in rigorously regulated conditions, with the proper humidity and temperature, and kept in acid-free cardboard boxes. While the museum nevertheless regularly exhibits works on paper, the duration of the shows is short.

The Roman poet Ovid (43 BC–AD 17-18) recorded their fates and those of the other Greek gods in his epic poem the Metamorphoses. Except for their miraculous deeds the gods were just like ordinary people: they felt love, anger and jealousy, and fought and committed adultery among themselves and with mortals. Mythological subjects were popular in ancient architecture, and later predominantly in Renaissance and Baroque art.
