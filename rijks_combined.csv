The symbolism of birds differs in different period and regions. For the Egyptians a bird symbolized the soul. Birds are often encountered in 17th-century Dutch genre scenes, in which they usually have a sexual connotation because the Dutch word â€˜vogelenâ€™ (birding) means to engage in sex. In medieval books of hours, birds had a purely ornamental function and were incorporated as faithfully as possible in the decorative borders. From the beginning of the 16th century birds became the subject of scientific study. Voyages of discovery fuelled interest in unknown, exotic species, which was reflected in the first illustrated encyclopedias.",Rijksstudio,Professional

They reacted against the established painters of the art academy who idealized reality. In contrast, the Hague School painters, including Jozef Israels, the brothers Maris and Anton Mauve, aspired to render what they saw realistically. They admired the French Barbizon School artists, who just like them, worked as much as possible en plein air (out in nature). They were intent on capturing the light and atmosphere of a landscape. Initially, the colours used by the Hague School artists were fairly gloomy, consisting of mostly greyish tints. This changed under the influence of French Impressionism; their palette became lighter and brighter and the facture looser. A younger generation of painters in Amsterdam continued this less formal painting tradition; they were called the Amsterdam Impressionists. ",Rijksstudio,Professional

The 17th-century Dutch works, in particular the masterpieces by Rembrandt, Frans Hals and Johannes Vermeer, enjoy national and international renown. The museum administers close to 6000 paintings on panel and on canvas. The collection of Early Netherlandish paintings is also famous; most of these panels have religious subjects and date from the 15th and 16th century. Moreover, there are also superb 14th-century portraits. After the Reformation, around 1600, painters began to specialize in a single subject. These new 'genres' were usually not, or only indirectly, religious in nature. Subjects that until then had been incorporated in religious scenes became independent genres, such as landscape, still life, and portraiture. Another genre was history painting; depictions of stories from the Bible, mythology or history. In addition, there were the popular genre scenes of people in their everyday surroundings, sometimes containing veiled symbolism. Because of the magnitude of the collection of paintings, they have been grouped by genre on the museumâ€™s website.",Rijksstudio,Professional

Yet for centuries little importance was attached to his name. Works now known as Vermeers were attributed to other artists. It was only in the 1870s that he was rediscovered and 35 paintings identified as his. The son of a silk worker who bought and sold art, Vermeer lived and worked in Delft all his life. He may have served his apprenticeship under fellow townsman Carel Fabritius. In 1653, he joined the local artists guild, which he led at various times. Vermeerâ€™s early paintings of historical scenes reveal the influence of the Utrecht Caravaggists. His later paintings are meticulous compositions of interiors featuring one or two figures, usually women. These are intimate genre paintings in which the subject is engaged in some everyday activity, usually in the light of a nearby window. Vermeer could render the way light plays on objects like few others.

In 1631, he moved to Amsterdam where he received numerous commissions for portraits. His many pupils included Ferdinand Bol, Govert Flinck and Carel Fabritius. In this period, Rembrandt develop a more powerful chiaroscuro, a looser brush and a greater sense of drama. He focused more on historical scenes, and made numerous etchings and drawings. In 1634, Rembrandt married Saskia Uylenburgh. They had a son, Titus, in 1641. Then a year later Saskia died. Later, in 1654, Rembrandt had a daughter with Hendrickje Stoffels.

The young German countâ€™s life was transformed when in 1544, when he inherited extensive lands in France and the Netherlands. These included an independent principality in southern France: Orange. Henceforth, he styled himself prince of Orange (later he was also referred to as William the Silent).

Philip II appointed him stadholder of Holland, Zeeland and Utrecht, the principal provinces. The characters and interests of the two men conflicted however, and they developed a mutual antipathy. Deeply pious, Philip tried to strengthen the monarchyâ€™s central authority and to maintain an exclusive monopoly for the Catholic Church. To achieve this he persecuted Protestants relentlessly. By contrast, William supported freedom of religion and conscience.

Protestant preachers whipped up crowds to destroy idolatrous decorations in churches. In response, Philip II sent an army to restore order. For four years, William led the defence of Holland and Zeeland against the Spanish army. Once the prospect of Spain reestablishing control had subsided in 1576, the provinces decided to continue as a confederation. William of Orange stood at the helm. In 1579, the seventeen provinces split into a Protestant North that supported the rebellion, and a Catholic South. The Spanish army renewed its campaign against the northern provinces.

In 1580, Philip II issued an urgent appeal to the people, an edict outlawing William. He declared the prince a walking target. On 10 July 1584, the fatal blow was struck. William of Orange was at Prinsenhof, his residence in Delft. As he was climbing the stairs, an assassin appeared and fired a pistol at him. His killer, Balthasar Gerards, claimed to have murdered William of Orange to save the world from that cruel and dreadful man who though a member of the nobility had turned away from the true Catholic faith purely and exclusively out of pride and lust for power and fame.",Rijksstudio,Professional

Everyday life of the streets of Rome developed into one of his favourite themes.

His style began to change under the influence of Anthony van Dyckâ€™s portraits. And when he saw Rubensâ€™s work in Antwerp in 1635, Lievens adopted the Baroque style completely. In 1644, Lievens returned to Amsterdam, where he remained for the rest of his life. He received major commissions in the Dutch Republic.

Asymmetry and irregularity typify the Rococo, a 19th-century term derived from rocaille (French for rockwork), that is fanciful rock and shell ornamentation. Other Rococo elements are C-scrolls, vines, pastel colours and serpentine lines. In this period graceful shepherds and shepherdesses and Chinoiserie motifs populate porcelain objects, as well as paintings, like those by the French artist Jean Ã‰tienne Liotard. This elegant style found a following throughout Europe, and in the 18th-century Netherlands manifested itself in the decorative arts, clothing, portraits and miniatures.

As different in nature as they may be, all of these works on paper share one important characteristic, namely they are fragile and extremely sensitive to light. For this reason, they are generally kept in storage in rigorously regulated conditions, with the proper humidity and temperature, and kept in acid-free cardboard boxes. While the museum nevertheless regularly exhibits works on paper, the duration of the shows is short. Accordingly, we urge you to take advantage of the opportunity when drawings, prints or photographs are displayed, because they usually disappear back into their dark drawers in just a few weeksâ€™ time.",Rijksstudio,Professional
rijkspro019,Rijks Museum,,https://www.rijksmuseum.nl/en/rijksstudio/subjects/classical-goddesses,,,Classical goddesses,,8,,,"In classical antiquity the Greeks believed that twelve gods, six of them female â€“ Demeter, Artemis, Pallas Athena, Aphrodite, Hestia, and Juno, the wife of the supreme god Zeus â€“ lived on Mount Olympus. The Roman poet Ovid (43 BCâ€“AD 17-18) recorded their fates and those of the other Greek gods in his epic poem the Metamorphoses. Except for their miraculous deeds the gods were just like ordinary people: they felt love, anger and jealousy, and fought and committed adultery among themselves and with mortals. Mythological subjects were popular in ancient architecture, and later predominantly in Renaissance and Baroque art. The Olympian goddesses â€“ with their Roman names of Ceres, Diana, Minerva, Venus, Vesta and Juno â€“ are frequently depicted, yet other deities, including Latona (Leto), the goddess of fertility Cybele (Rhea) and the Three Fates also figure regularly in art.",Rijksstudio,Professional
rijkspro020,Rijks Museum,,https://www.rijksmuseum.nl/en/rijksstudio/subjects/biblical-messengers,,,Biblical messengers,,6,,,"People who communicate the messages of God feature in both the Old and the New Testament of the Bible. In the Old Testament, prophets mediate between people and God, speaking in his name and making prophecies. Of the prophets, only Jeremiah and Elijah are regularly depicted in art.

In the New Testament the life and suffering of Christ is described by the four evangelists: Matthew, Mark, Luke and John. The accounts in these â€˜Gospelsâ€™ have been illustrated extensively in art since the Middle Ages. The evangelists themselves are less frequently portrayed, and basically just as â€˜writersâ€™ in Gospel Books. Only John the Evangelist, author of the last book of the Bible about the Apocalypse, appears in independent depictions. 
Finally, there are the apostles (literally: â€˜people who give a message on someoneâ€™s behalfâ€™), who were initially Christâ€™s disciples. After his ascension, Christ sent them out to spread his teachings throughout the world.",Rijksstudio,Professional

His father - also called Willem van de Velde (hence I and II) â€“ started life as a sailor and later became an artist for the Dutch navy. At fifteen, Van de Velde II was apprenticed to Simon de Vlieger, who specialised in atmospheric seascapes. Van de Velde IIâ€™s early marines are generally tranquil, showing groups of fishing boats off the coast. After he and his father moved to England in 1672, Van de Velde II broadened his range. While he continued to paint marines, he made numerous portraits of individual vessels, such as royal yachts and battle ships. Van de Velde II was commissioned by the British king to paint various naval battles.",Rijksstudio,Professional

Before then he was called Saul and was a fanatic persecutor of Christians. When he was about 24 years old he was struck by lightning while on his way to Damascus in Syria. He converted to Christianity and took on the name of Paul. He became an indefatigable champion of his faith. Paul travelled extensively throughout the countries around the Mediterranean Sea, founding various Christian communities, with which he maintained contact. His letters are an important part of the New Testament. In art he is often depicted as an old man with a book (symbolizing his many writings) and a sword. Like Peter, Paul is considered one of the founders of the Church.

Gerard, also known as Gerrit, was its most successful member. Following a stay in Italy in the 1610s, he returned to Utrecht in 1620. He was a prominent representative of a group of painters that have become known as the Utrecht Caravaggists, Dutch followers of the Italian artist Caravaggio. The latter was especially known for his nocturnal scenes of candlelit figures. In the 1630s, Van Honthorst acquired a name in court circles as a portrait painter, which led him to move to The Hague in 1637. In 1649, Van Honthorst was commissioned to paint part of the decoration of the Orange hall at the stadholder's palace of Huis ten Bosch. In 1652, he returned to Utrecht, where he died four years later.",Rijksstudio,Professional

At the age of eleven he started painting and drawing lessons at Groningenâ€™s Akademie Minerva. In 1842, he went to Amsterdam to study under painters Jan Adam Kruseman and Jan Willem Pieneman. He later visited Paris, where he perfected his academic style of painting. He subsequently visited Germany, studying the German Romantic artists.

Despite his training, IsraÃ«ls did not devote his career to painting historical scenes. While recuperating from an illness at the Dutch fishing village of Zandvoort, he was appalled by the tragic lot of the fishermen and their families. His sober, restrained paintings depicting life in the fishing village earned him international fame. Critics compared his impasto brushwork, his warm colours and his use of chiaroscuro with the work of Rembrandt. IsraÃ«ls taught numerous pupils, among them his son Isaac.",Rijksstudio,Professional
